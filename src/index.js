    "Located on the west coast of Africa, along the River Gambia and surrounded by Senegal, The Gambia is one of Africa's smallest countries. The entire country is about 11 300 square kilometres, with a total population of about 2.8 million people. It's capital city, Banjul, is the most densely populated area in The Gambia, with about 400 000 residents in the greater Banjul area. The wet-and-dry tropical climate of The Gambia is characterized by distinct intense rainy followed by dry seasons. There is very little forest cover, with the most forested area being the Bijo Forest, but the country is very biologically diverse despite this, both when it comes to wildlife and fauna. The Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) has shown great promise in being used to detect landmines. ",

The prehistory of Sri Lanka goes back at least 125 000, with some suggesting that it goes back as far as 500 000 years. One of the first written references to the country  is from the Indian epic Ramayana, which tells the story of how the nation of Lanka was created by the divine sculptor Vishvakarma for Kubera, the God of Wealth.",
